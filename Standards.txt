 
 #General
 Imports will be condensed using * when possible
 
 All class member variables are encapsulated whenever possible
 
 Private global member variables are formatted as follows: thisvariable
 
 Variables local to methods are formatted as follows: this_variable or foo
 
 Methods are formatted as follows: thisMethod()
 
 Set method parameters will be named the same as the variable they will be setting,
 and will set with this.variable
 
 #Class formatting
 1) variables
 2) Constructors, parameterless then parameters, going from less to more complex
 3) Set/Get methods
 4) other methods
 
 Note: Output method should usually be last
 
 
 *Exceptions
 The map class will permit public access to its member ComplexLists for convienence (ComplexLists must error check themselves)
 
 #Class Comments
